# Example sysexts for Fedora image based systems

For Fedora CoreOS, Atomic Desktops, IoT, or other Bootable Container systems
(and classic otree/rpm-ostree systems).

Currently only built for:
- Fedora Silverblue 41
- Fedora Kinoite 41
- Fedora CoreOS next

## How does this fit with bootc and Bootable Containers?

The planned user experience for using those sysexts is that they are built as
container layers, pushed to a registry as distinct tags, downloaded, managed
and updated in sync with the OS by bootc. See:
[bootc#7](https://github.com/containers/bootc/issues/7) and
[README.containers.md](README.containers.md).

## Installing and updating using systemd-sysupdate

In the meantime, you can use systemd-sysupdate to manually install and update
them:

```
$ sudo install -d -m 0755 -o 0 -g 0 /var/lib/extensions /var/lib/extensions.d /etc/sysupdate.d
$ sudo restorecon -RFv /var/lib/extensions /var/lib/extensions.d /etc/sysupdate.d
$ SYSEXT="btop"
$ RELEASE_TAG="fedora-kinoite-41"
$ URL="https://github.com/travier/fedora-sysexts/releases/download/${RELEASE_TAG}/${SYSEXT}.conf"
$ curl --silent --location "${URL}" | sudo tee "/etc/sysupdate.d/${SYSEXT}.conf"
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysupdate list
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysupdate update
$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysext.service
$ systemd-sysext status
```

Then any further updates can be done with:

```
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysupdate update
$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysext.service
$ systemd-sysext status
```

I recommend updating them at the same time as you update your system with
bootc/rpm-ostree so that the content of the sysexts matches what is on your
base system as right now there are no guarantees there. We should fix that when
integrating with bootc.

## Know issues

Make sure to use `systemctl restart systemd-sysext.service` instead of
`systemd-sysext merge` until the issue below is resolved. `systemd-sysext
unmerge` is safe to use.

## Building

Make sure that you have the following packages installed:
- `cpio`
- `erofs-utils`
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
- `podman`
- `wget`

To build the `python` sysext:

```
$ cd python
```

List the supported target images:

```
$ just targets
```

Build the sysext for Fedora CoreOS next:

```
$ just build "quay.io/fedora/fedora-coreos:next
```

I recommend building those from a toolbox as it requires `root` privileges. It
should work with any rootless, privileged, non-SELinux confined container.

## Manual download

See the [GitHub release](https://github.com/travier/fedora-sysexts/releases)
for your version of Fedora.

## Manual setup without systemd-sysupdate

Setup the `extensions` directory:

```
$ sudo install -d -m 0755 -o 0 -g 0 /var/lib/extensions/
$ sudo restorecon -RFv /var/lib/extensions/
```

Install the extensions:

```
$ SYSEXT=python
$ sudo install -m 644 -o 0 -g 0 ${SYSEXT}/${SYSEXT}*.raw /var/lib/extensions/${SYSEXT}.raw
```

Enable them (see known issue for details):

```
$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysext.service
$ systemd-sysext status
```

Try it out:

```
$ python -c 'print("Hello from a sysext!")'
```
